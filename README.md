##Problem statement

Perform sentiment analysis of hindi language imposition in India using tweets.

##My approach

I performed rule based analysis of twitter data to achieve the purpose. Rule based analysis performs sentiment analysis based on a set of manually crafted rules. These rules identifies things such as subjectivity and polarity by using a lexicon. A lexicon is a dictionary of positive and negative opinion words set and expressions with their associated polarity scores. A basic example of a rule based method would be to define two lists of polarized words for both negative and positive polarity words. Then given a text, count the scores of both positive and negative words. If we have a more positive score, then it is a positive text and if we have a more negative text, then it is a negative word. If both scores are equal, then the text is neutral.
